# MyPopularMovies
the MyPopularMovies android application uses theMovieDB API to fetch the latest/most popular movies,
in order to use this android app you will need an API KEY from theMovieDB API(https://www.themoviedb.org/),
once you have an api key you will need to add it in the MovieListService.java file where is says
String API_KEY = "your API key here", replace the "your API key here" with your own api key.
