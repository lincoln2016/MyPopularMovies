# MyPopularMovies
the MyPopularMovies android application uses theMovieDB API to fetch the most popular movies or top rated movies.
In order to use this android app, you will need an API KEY from theMovieDB API(https://www.themoviedb.org/),
once you have an api key you will need to add it in the values/strings.xml file where it says
"api_key" = "Your API KEY Here", replace the "Your API KEY Here" with your api key.
